Code and data to replicate Gilli, Martino and Calcaterra, Matteo and Emmerling, Johannes and Granella, Francesco, _Climate Change Impacts on the Within-Country Income Distributions_ (July 25, 2023). http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4520461

To run all files, execute `code/run.sh`. Please note that the creation of a python environment requires `conda`, and the correct replication requires [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) to be installed and be located in PATH.

While all necessary scripts are in place, the repo is currently still being cleaned and arranged for an easier replication.
